"Good" game engine

I have coded two games on it to test the functionality.
I am still looking on improving the engine as in reconstructing it, so no documentation for it yet.
Examples are the two below games (Dropper, Snake)

<h3>Dropper</h3>
Inspired by my Sprig game, fall down & avoid obstacles to get to the gold block
(A release is in the releases section)

<h3>Snake</h3>
Just to test the functionality, release coming soon
